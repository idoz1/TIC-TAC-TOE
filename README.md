# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three identical symbols—either Xs or Os.


Game Rules:
Players: Two players take turns. One uses "X," and the other uses "O."
Gameplay: Players alternate placing their symbol in one of the nine empty spaces on the grid.
Winning: The first player to align three of their symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game.
Draw: If all nine spaces are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
The game is simple, yet requires strategic thinking to block the opponent while trying to create your own winning line.
